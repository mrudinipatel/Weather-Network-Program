# Weather-Network-Program

## Functionality

This program was built using Python (version 3.9.5) and the Openweathermap API.

Through this small project, I was able to learn about creating GUIs using Python's *tkinter* package. I was also able to implement basic encryption through environment variables in order to hide the API key using .env and .gitignore files, as well as Python dotenv. 

This project allowed me to learn the process of retrieving/presenting data from a JSON file produced by the API. I was able to explore using the *time* and *request* packages as well.

## Future Improvements

I am aware the design of this program is quite simple, so in the future I would like to add features to enhance its usability. In particular, I would like to
add a weather image depicting the weather forecast (i.e. a sun if forecast is sunny, etc). I would also like to deploy this program as a heroku app/website so
that it is more easily accessible.

## Compilation & Execution Command
(Ensure you have the correct Python version installed)

```python3.9 -u weather.py```
