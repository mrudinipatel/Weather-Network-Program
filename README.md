# Weather-Network-Program ðŸŒ¤

Title says it all - this repo contains a program that showcases the current weather conditions of any location of user choice. This program was built using Python (version 3.9.5) and the Openweathermap API.  

Through this small project, I was able to learn about creating GUIs using Python's *tkinter* package. I was also able to implement basic encryption through environment variables in order to hide the API key using .env and .gitignore files, as well as Python dotenv. 

This project allowed me to learn the process of retrieving/presenting data from a JSON file produced by the API. I was able to explore using the *time* and *request* packages as well.

## Future Improvements ðŸ”®
I'm aware the design of this program is quite simple, so in the future I would like to add features to enhance its usability. In particular, I would like to add a weather image depicting the weather forecast (i.e. a sun if forecast is sunny, etc). 

I would also like to deploy this program as a heroku app/website so that it's more easily accessible via a public domain URL.

## To Launch ðŸš€
Ensure you have Python version 3.9.5 installed before running the following command in your terminal:

```python3.9 -u weather.py```
